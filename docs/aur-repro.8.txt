repro(8)
========

Name
----
repro - reproducible builds utility


Synopsis
--------
'repro' [options] <local-package>


Description
-----------
'repro' is a script to help with verifying and checking reproducibility of
packages. It builds a linkman:systemd-nspawn[1] container with the Arch Linux
bootstrap image to build packages in a clean chroot.

It takes a package as an argument and attempts to recreate the package with
the information provided with linkman:BUILDINFO[5]. It will use the Arch Linux
archive to fetch packages with the correct pkgver.


Options
-------
*-h*::
        Print help.

*-d*::
        When enabled linkman:diffoscope[1] is run on the produced packages.
        `DIFFOSCOPE` can be set in linkman:repro.conf[5] to change the
        diffoscope command.

*-f*::
        When enabled, `repro` check for a PKGBUILD file in the current working
        directory. This one is used to build the package instead of checking out
        a PKGBUILD from asp.

*-n*::
        When enabled makepkg runs with --nocheck.

*-o*::
        Set the output directory for the rebuilt packages. Defaults to
        `./build`.
